## SQL - Introduction

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is used to interact with relational databases. It helps in storing, retrieving, modifying, and managing data.

### Key Uses of SQL:

* Creating and modifying database structures (tables, views, etc.)
* Inserting, updating, and deleting data
* Querying data using specific conditions
* Controlling user access and permissions

### Where SQL is Used:

* Works with relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server
* Commonly used in backend development, data analysis, and data engineering

### Why SQL Matters:

* Essential for working with structured data
* Used in almost every data-driven application
* Easy to learn but powerful for complex operations

### History (Brief):

* Developed by IBM in the 1970s
* Became a standard by ANSI and ISO
* Still widely used today in modern tech stacks

## Types of Databases

Databases store and organize data. There are several types, depending on how data is structured and accessed.

### 1. Relational Databases

* Data is stored in tables (rows and columns)
* Uses SQL for querying
* Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

### 2. NoSQL Databases

* Non-tabular, flexible data models (key-value, document, graph, etc.)
* Useful for big data and real-time apps
* Example: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Firebase

### 3. Hierarchical Databases

* Data is organized in a tree-like structure
* One-to-many relationships
* Example: IBM Information Management System (IMS)

### 4. Network Databases

* More flexible than hierarchical; uses graph-like structures
* Allows many-to-many relationships
* Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS)

### 5. Object-Oriented Databases

* Data is stored as objects, like in OOP languages
* Supports complex data types
* Example: db4o, ObjectDB
